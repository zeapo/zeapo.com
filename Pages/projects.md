### Work ###

#### [Thesis] The Augmented Block Cimmino Distributed Solver (ABCD Solver) ####

The ABCD Solver is the result of the work done during my PhD. It is a distributed hybrid (iterative/direct) solver for large sparse linear systems. It is written in C++ and only supports real (double precision) matrices for the moment.
